# reviewcue Task Breakdown

This breakdown keeps release readiness work concrete and reviewable for reviewcue.

## Current v0.1.0 Tasks

- Keep the README quickstart aligned with the commands exposed by `package.json`.
- Maintain at least one local verification path that exercises the package before release.
- Keep package metadata, license details, and public repository links complete enough for install-time inspection.
- Record follow-up behavior gaps in this file or the roadmap instead of implying finished coverage.

## Verification Tasks

- Run the package test script before opening a release PR.
- Run the package smoke or pack check when package contents, CLI entry points, or docs change.
- Re-run ReleaseBox readiness after changing release workflows, package metadata, or public documentation.
